# Ecommerce showcase
This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com)

Sanity is used as a content management system and stipe is used for payment.

This project is ment for me to practice my skills as a frontend developer and includes technics such as sorting, filtering and data fetching.
I'm not acually selling the products on the website but you can still go through with a purchase by paying with a test card.

## How to use
The only clickable links on the navbar is the logo and the "New" link.

For payment you can enter your email and name and for all the card numbers you can just repeat 42 like this.
