# Ecommerce showcase
This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com)

Sanity is used as a content management system and stipe is used for payment.

This project is ment for me to practice my skills as a frontend developer and includes technics such as sorting, filtering and data fetching.

## How to use
For payment you can enter your email and name and for all the card numbers you can just repeat 42 like this.
